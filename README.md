# static-file-server
A Go based static file server. See the [release page](https://github.com/badlogic/static-file-server/releases/tag/1.0.0) for binaries for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Usage: `static-server <directory> <port>`

My use case is serving static `.css/.js/.html/.wasm` files while working on WASM code and I do not want to install Nginx, Python, whatever.
